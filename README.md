# Lee Sin V2
Lee Sin V2 is the second version of the Lee Sin Discord Bot that I have created. I am working on adding all of the old features that Lee Sin had, plus some extras. Rather than using Python like I did the first time around, I am coding this bot in GO using the DiscordGo library.

## Installation
Standard install. This is writted in Go version 1.23.4. You will need to create some files that are not included in this repository. One being a .env file, where sensitive data such as the Discord token is stored, and a /config/constants.go file where you will write your own list of variables to export like a prefix string for commands.
